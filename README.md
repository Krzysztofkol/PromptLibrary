# PromptLibrary
The collection of my favourite LLM/LMM/VLM prompts

Please note that I don't claim authorship of all of the prompts. Some of them are found online e.g. on Reddit, Twitter or from free newsletters, and some of them are developed by me. Please let me know if I didn't give you credit for your prompt so that I can update the repo and ensure your authorship is explicitly stated.
